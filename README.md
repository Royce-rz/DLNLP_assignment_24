# DLNLP_assignment_24
## Project Description
This is the assignment for ELEC0141 Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing.This project focuses on leveraging deep learning techniques for sentiment analysis, specifically targeting movie reviews from the IMDb dataset. It employs advanced natural language processing methods, including GloVe embeddings for transforming text into meaningful vector spaces and LSTM networks to effectively understand and process the temporal dependencies in text. The objective is to develop a robust model capable of accurately classifying sentiments expressed in movie reviews as either positive or negative.


## Data Preperation
The data is to large that can not upload to Github,The following link is to download the data.
